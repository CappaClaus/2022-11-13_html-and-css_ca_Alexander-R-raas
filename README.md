Course Assignment

# Course asignment for HTML and CSS

Asignment was to take what I have designed in previous course and make it into a full function website

## Description

This is the course assignment in html and css.
Without a doubt the biggest challenge so far. I've never done anything close to this and it was a journy that felt incredibly rewarding, but also gave me more headache than the rest of this year combined. Im not sure how many hours i've spend on this but i lost count after 50+.

That being said, there are a few kinks and the responsivness was a real though cookie. Im not 100% satified with the work, as there are problems with how some elements when getting to smaller seizes. Changes have been made on almost every page from the design file, as somethings i couldn't for the life of me find out of, and other changes just seemed better suited.

-problem 1: Pictures
After sending each and every image into a website designed for compressing images (I got some of the immages down to over 95% reduced size!) but i still couldnt manage to fit in the 200kb limit. Some images made it, but others simply couldnt work around it without making it way too blurry.

-problem 2: Responsivness
Responsivness was going fine untill i hit the lower end of the spectrum, namly phone and low tablet. I am not sure why, but after sitting in inspection mode on firefox for the better part of a day, i gave up. Which is why lower than 1300px they all lign up the same way. Not the way i intended it to be but worked out somewhat.

-problem 3: Mountain of code
I've tried to make the code as tidy as possible, not repeating and following theDRY principle, but it is still somewhat messy. Though after it did improve alot after i cleaned it up.

All in all, im quite happy in how it turned out to be as this is the first time i've ever tried html and css.

### Dependencies
